      <li>3/2 lb flank steak</li>
      <li>1/2 cup pesto</li>
      <li>2 Tbsp white vinegar</li>
      <li>1 Tbsp water</li>

    <ol>
      <li>Mix together the pesto, vinegar and water.</li>
      <li>Sprinkle both sides of meat with coarse salt and allow steak to sit at room temperature for 30-40 minutes before grilling</li>
      <li>Grill to desired temperature. We like our meat medium which is 140-145 Degrees F. Depending on the thickness of your steak it will be about 5 minutes per side.</li>
      <li>A few minutes before it is done brush both sides with pesto.</li>
      <li>Remove from grill and allow to sit at room temperature for 5 minutes or so.</li>
      <li>Slice steak against the grain and drizzle with remaining pesto mixture.</li>
